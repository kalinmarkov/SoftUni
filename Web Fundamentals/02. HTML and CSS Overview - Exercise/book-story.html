            Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.
            On her desc, lying between the copies of <em>Nature</em>, <em>New Scientist</em>,
            and all the others scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed
            copy of <em>On The Road</em>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and
            the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.

            She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under the poster
            with the Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who
            have nothing better to do</q>.
